# CNN_Project
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.

Key Features:

CNN Architecture: (Replace with specific architecture used, e.g., LeNet-5)
Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques like (e.g., normalization) for improved training.
Training: Utilizes an efficient optimizer (e.g., Adam) for fast convergence.
Notebook:

MNIST_CNN.ipynb: This notebook contains the complete code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
Instructions:

Install required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy).
Open MNIST_CNN.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Run all the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
Further Exploration:

This project provides a solid foundation for exploring advanced CNN techniques for digit recognition.  Consider:

Experimenting with different CNN architectures within the notebook.
Implementing data augmentation techniques within the notebook.
Visualizing learned filters to understand the features extracted (code additions required).
This Jupyter Notebook offers a user-friendly and customizable CNN solution for MNIST handwritten digit classification.
